# Quiz Progress Refactoring

This document explains the refactoring of the quiz progress tracking system to fix issues with progress contamination between different quizzes.

## Background

The original system had several issues:
1. Inconsistent quiz name normalization across different files
2. Lack of a centralized service for quiz progress management
3. Cross-contamination between quizzes due to inadequate storage key generation
4. Missing data validation for quiz progress

## Solution Overview

The refactoring introduces a new dedicated `QuizProgressService` that provides:

1. Consistent quiz name normalization with validation against known quiz names
2. Robust storage key management to prevent cross-contamination
3. Clean API for loading and saving quiz progress
4. Automatic data validation and fixing
5. API-first approach with localStorage backup
6. Clear error handling

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **QuizProgressService** - `/frontend/services/QuizProgressService.js`
   - A dedicated service for managing quiz progress with a clean API
   - Includes built-in contamination detection and cleanup
   - Uses a consistent approach to quiz name normalization

2. **BaseQuiz Enhancements** - `/frontend/quizzes/BaseQuiz.js`
   - Updated to use the QuizProgressService
   - Provides standard methods for loading and saving progress
   - Ensures consistent data validation

3. **Index Page Integration** - `/frontend/scripts/index.js`
   - Uses QuizProgressService to display quiz progress on the index page
   - Maintains backward compatibility with legacy data formats

### Usage in Quiz Files

For quiz-specific JavaScript files, you should:

1. Replace direct APIService calls for progress with QuizProgressService calls
2. Use the BaseQuiz.loadProgress() and BaseQuiz.saveProgress() methods
3. Remove any custom quiz name normalization logic

Example:

```javascript
// Before
const apiProgress = await this.apiService.getQuizProgress(this.quizName);

// After
// The BaseQuiz class now handles this automatically!
const hasProgress = await this.loadProgress();
```

### Global Service Initialization

The QuizProgressService is initialized globally when the index page loads:

```javascript
// In index.js
window.quizProgressService = new QuizProgressService();
```

You can access it from any component:

```javascript
// Access the global instance
const progressService = window.quizProgressService || new QuizProgressService();
```

## Migration Notes

1. The service automatically detects and cleans contaminated data
2. All existing storage keys remain supported for backward compatibility
3. New quiz progress is stored in the new format with strict validation
4. The service uses API as the primary data source with localStorage as fallback

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test quiz progress on multiple quizzes to ensure no cross-contamination
2. Verify progress display on the index page matches actual quiz progress
3. Test resuming in-progress quizzes
4. Test completing quizzes and starting new ones

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for syncing progress between devices
2. Implement better offline mode support
3. Add progress visualization components
